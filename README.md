# css-challenges
A collection of pure CSS projects. This repo documents my solutions to Scrimbaâ€™s CSS Challenges course.

âœ¨ **Whatâ€™s inside**
  - Recreated components from platforms like GitHub, CodePen, and Instagram
  - Interactive UI elements such as flashcards, progress bars, and loading animations
  - Responsive designs built with modern CSS (flexbox, grid, variables, transitions)

ðŸŽ¯ **Why I'm doing this**
  - These challenges have been great for strengthening my fundamentals. Plus, I can refer these later when I need a quick solution.

ðŸš€ **How to use**
  Each challenge is contained in its own folder with:
    - index.html â€” the markup
    - style.css â€” the CSS solution
    - sometimes a preview GIF or screenshot
